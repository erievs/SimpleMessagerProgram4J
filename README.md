# SimpleMessagerProgram4J
A very simple messaging cleint make as a effort to test how much data is required for my video game. Built using java Sockets! (Part of IslandWorld Testing)

Feel free to do whatever you want with this code.


All this does is just use sockets to send data to people.

FYI: This is really bad code and the comments are misspelled to a high degree, I wrote this at 2am so I was tired.

Server Setup:

1. Launch the jar
2. Input the address you want (the default is localhost)
3. Input the port you want to use
4. You're dont you can type in text and press enter to send data to all cleints!

Client Setup:

1. Put in your username
2. Put in the port and ip of the sever
3. You're done type in text if you want and press enter!

Your data is not encrypted so be careful, don't use it for drug deals, murder for hires, cyber crime, etc.
